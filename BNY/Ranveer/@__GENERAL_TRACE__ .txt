1. @ReactJS
ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience.

# Component-Based Architecture
UI is built using reusable components, which manage their own state and logic.

# JSX (JavaScript XML)
Allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript, making UI code more readable and expressive.

# Virtual DOM
React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the real DOM by only changing the parts that need to be updated, improving performance.

# Unidirectional Data Flow
Data flows from parent to child components, making state management more predictable.

# Declarative UI
You describe what the UI should look like based on the state, and React handles the rendering and updating.

Alternatives: Vue, Angular, svelte, @NextJS.

2. @NodeJS
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser, typically on a server.

# Built on Chrome’s V8 Engine
Fast JavaScript execution thanks to the same engine that powers the Chrome browser.

# Non-blocking I/O & Event-Driven
Perfect for handling many concurrent connections without slowing down.

# Single Programming Language (JavaScript)
You can build both frontend and backend with JavaScript.

# Huge Ecosystem (NPM)
Comes with NPM (Node Package Manager) — the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries.

# Cross-platform
Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

Alternatives: @Deno, Bun. 

3. @ExpressJS
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides tools and features to build web servers and APIs easily.

It's like a lightweight wrapper around Node's core http module that simplifies the process of routing, handling requests, and managing middleware.

# Routing System
Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and URLs with ease.

# Middleware Support
Functions that run before the final request handler (for logging, auth, parsing JSON, etc.).

# Request & Response Utilities
Helpers like @req.query, @req.params, @res.json(), and @res.status().

# Static File Serving
Serve HTML, CSS, JS, and images directly from a public folder.

# Integration with Templating Engines
Like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars for dynamic HTML pages.

# Easy API Creation
Commonly used to build REST APIs and backend services.

Alternatives: @Fastify, Koa, @NestJS.

4. MongoDB
# MongoDB is a NoSQL database designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data using a document-oriented model instead of traditional tables and rows (like SQL databases).
# MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents (technically called BSON – Binary JSON), which are flexible, human-readable, and easy to work with in JavaScript-based environments like Node.js.
# MongoDB Atlas – Cloud-based MongoDB service.
Compass – GUI for MongoDB (visualize and manage data).
Mongoose – ODM (Object-Document Mapper) library to interact with MongoDB in Node.js easily.

Alternatives: Couchbase, Firebase, Amazon @DocumentDB.

5. Redis
# Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data store that is commonly used as a database, cache.
# It’s known for being extremely fast, because it stores data in memory (RAM) instead of on disk like traditional databases.
# Think of Redis as a super-fast key-value store where you can store and retrieve data in milliseconds. It’s widely used to speed up applications by caching frequently used data.

Alternatives: Memcached, @Hazelcast.

6. React @Tanstack Query:
# React Query (also known as @TanStack Query) is a powerful data-fetching and state management library for React that makes it easy to:

# Fetch, cache, and update remote data (like from APIs)

# Keep your UI in sync with the server

# Reduce boilerplate code compared to using @useEffect and @useState manually

Alternatives: Apollo Client, RTK Query.

7. Stream SDK:
Stream offers a set of ready-made APIs and tools that help developers add real-time features like:
# Chat API
# Video & Audio Calling API

Stream SDK provides APIs that handle all the complex parts of real-time messaging, video calling, and social feeds, so developers don't have to build them from scratch.

Alternatives: Twilio, Agora.

8. Recoil
Recoil is a state management library for React that makes it easier to manage and share data (called "state") across different parts of your app — especially when multiple components need to access or update the same data.

# Atom - A piece of shared state (like a global @useState).
# Selector - A derived/computed value (like calculated totals or filters).
# @RecoilRoot - A provider that enables Recoil in your app

Alternatives: Redux Toolkit, @Zustand.

9. @Shadcn
@shadcn/@ui is a collection of beautifully designed and accessible UI components built with:

1. Tailwind CSS
2. Radix UI primitives (Provides core functionality like keyboard navigation, trap focus, etc which are not styled).
3. Fully compatible with React

Alternatives: Chakra UI, Material UI, Radix UI.

10. JDBC
JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity.
It is an API (Application Programming Interface) in Java that allows Java applications to interact with databases.

Alternatives: JPA (Java Persistence API), Hibernate.

11. MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
It stores data in tables made up of rows and columns, and you use SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage that data.

Alternatives: PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite.

12. Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic.
It simplifies the process of using Redux by reducing boilerplate code and improving developer experience.

Alternatives: @Zustand, Recoil.
